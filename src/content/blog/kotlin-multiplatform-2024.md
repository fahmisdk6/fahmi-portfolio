Kotlin Multiplatform has matured significantly. Here's what it's like to use it in a real production project.

## What Works Well

- Shared networking and data layers
- Shared business logic and validation
- Kotlinx.serialization across platforms

## What's Still Rough

- iOS debugging experience
- CocoaPods integration quirks
- Limited UI sharing (though Compose Multiplatform is improving)

## Verdict

KMP is production-ready for sharing business logic. For UI, stick with native or Flutter for now.
