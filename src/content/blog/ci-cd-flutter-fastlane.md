Manually building and deploying apps is tedious and error-prone. Here's how to automate the entire release pipeline.

## Setting Up Fastlane

Fastlane handles signing, building, and uploading to both App Store Connect and Google Play Console.

## GitHub Actions Integration

Trigger builds on every push to main, run tests, and deploy automatically when a release tag is created.

## Key Benefits

- Consistent builds across the team
- Reduced human error in the release process
- Faster iteration cycles
